# catan
A Settlers of Catan clone I made by myself to teach myself OOD principles.

Some of the code I wrote for this project was pretty inefficient. When I wrote it, I didn't have the best grasp of data structures like stacks and queues and made my own questionable versions of them. However, I think this project gave me a good idea of how to plan for larger coding projects as well as some low-level implementation ideas.
